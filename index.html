            <h2>Why Use Markdown?</h2>
            <p>Markdown has some real advantages:
                <ul>
                    <li>It's lightweight.</li>
                    <li>It's plain text, so it can be written and opened on any device running any operating system.</li>
                    <li>Converting from Markdown text to particular file formats &mdash; e.g., DOCX, HTML, PDF &mdash; is a simple matter.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>So, if you're someone who frequently writes text that needs to be published to a number of different formats, you'll likely find Markdown incredibly useful. Write your text once, then export it to whatever file formats you need.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, if you frequently need to create documents with highly complex visual formatting, and you don't often need to output your work to multiple file formats, Markdown may not be the best tool for your purposes.</p>

            <h2>Is Markdown Difficult to Learn?</h2>
            <p>Not only is Markdown not difficult to learn, it's really quite simple. In fact, you may find you know a good bit of the syntax already. Have you ever enclosed a word in asterisks in a Facebook post because italics aren't available?</p>
            <p>That's exactly how you create italics in Markdown. When you write <code>*italics*</code> in your Markdown text, it will output as <em>italics</em>.</p>

            <h2>Creating Lists in Markdown</h2>
            <p>Likely you already know how to make lists, too. To create an unordered list that looks like this:
                <ul>
                    <li>Item 1</li>
                    <li>Item 2</li>
                    <li>Item 3</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>You need only write:</p>
            <pre>
                * Item 1
                * Item 2
                * Item 3
            </pre>
            <p>Ordered lists are just as easy. To get:
                <ol>
                    <li>Item</li>
                    <li>Item</li>
                    <li>Item</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>Just write:</p>
            <pre>
                1. Item
                2. Item
                3. Item
            </pre>
